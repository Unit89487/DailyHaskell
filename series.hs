 --This is probably not even a geometric series. It's not. Geometric series... they diverge. All of them diverge? 
 --That doesn't seem right. Lol. 

geometricSeries a = a + (1/a) + (1/(1/a)) + (1/(1/(1/a)))


--Need a way to terminate inifite series when they've reached a level of approximation of some number that I think is adequately precise
